# PHASE-3-PROJECT

INTRODUCTION
CHICAGO  is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois and in the Midwestern United States. With a population of 2,746,388, as of the 2020 census, it is the third-most populous city in the United States after New York City and Los Angeles. As the seat of Cook County, the second-most populous county in the U.S., Chicago is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area, often colloquially called "Chicagoland" and home to 9.6 million residents. 

BUSSINESS UNDERSTANDING
The City of Chicago has implemented E-Crash a reporting tool for car accidents that happen within the City of Chicago, but with all this recorded data they have not been able to make strides in minimizing accidents on the streets of Chicago city.
With the data recorded through the E-Crash system and use of machine learning principles, I can find primary contributory causes of car accidents and recommend solutions based on interpretation of results.
This will in turn help keep the citizens of Chicago safe through preventative measures therefore reduced car crashes, help in implementation of city planning principles to reduces the crashes and limit the amount of resources the City of Chicago utilises to solve these cases

OBJECTIVE:
Build a classifier to predict the primary contributory cause of a car accident, given information about the car, the people in the car, the road conditions  and other various factors included in the data set![image](https://github.com/Daniel-Wahome/PHASE-3-PROJECT/assets/152204360/dba081c0-225e-4443-b67f-290ce9575155)
